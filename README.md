# üè† Household Services Management App

## Overview  
This project is a **full-stack web application** designed to manage household services by connecting **customers**, **service professionals**, and an **admin**. It supports end-to-end workflows like booking services, managing requests, professional approvals, and feedback collection.  

The app demonstrates skills in **backend development (Flask, SQLAlchemy)**, **frontend templating (Jinja2, Bootstrap)**, and **database design** with a well-structured schema.

## Key Highlights  
- **Role-Based Dashboards**  
  - **Admin** ‚Äì Manage services, approve professionals, block users, monitor system activity.  
  - **Customers** ‚Äì Browse & book services, schedule requests, track status, provide ratings.  
  - **Professionals** ‚Äì Accept/reject jobs, track service history, view ratings.  

- **Full-Stack Implementation**  
  - **Backend:** Flask + SQLAlchemy  
  - **Frontend:** Jinja2 + HTML + Bootstrap5  
  - **Visuals:** ChartJS for interactive service/request summaries  

- **Database Design**  
  - 6 core tables: `Users`, `Customers`, `ServiceProfessionals`, `Services`, `ServiceRequests`, `ServiceRejections`  
  - Clear relationships between roles, services, and transactions  
  - Optimized schema for scalability and search functionality  

---

## Architecture  
- **Templates** ‚Äì Role-specific UIs (`admin-`, `customer-`, `prof-`) using Jinja2  
- **Static Assets** ‚Äì CSS, Bootstrap, and branding  
- **Backend** ‚Äì Flask controllers for each role, with centralized DB models  
- **Database** ‚Äì SQLite (tested with DBeaver)  

* High-level flow:*  
1. Users sign up/login.  
2. Customers create service requests.  
3. Professionals accept/reject requests.  
4. Admin monitors activity and ensures quality.
